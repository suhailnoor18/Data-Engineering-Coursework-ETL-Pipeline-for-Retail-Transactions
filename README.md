# Data Engineering Coursework

## Overview
This project is part of a Data Engineering coursework that involves building an ETL pipeline for retail transactions. The dataset includes customer, sales, and product transaction data from multiple sources. The project covers data extraction, transformation, cleaning, feature engineering, and loading the final dataset into an SQLite database.

## Project Structure
- **Data Extraction**: Downloading and loading CSV files.
- **Data Exploration**: Inspecting data types, attributes, missing values, and outliers.
- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, correcting errors, and renaming columns.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features such as age groups and total purchase value.
- **Data Loading**: Storing the cleaned dataset in an SQLite database.

## Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- SQLite for database storage
- Jupyter Notebook for analysis

## Challenges and Learnings
- Dealing with missing values and outliers in transaction data.
- Merging multiple datasets efficiently.
- Implementing SQL database schema and constraints.
